# NoteIt-iOS
David Seitz's apprentice project

An app which makes taking notes faster and simpler. With a prominently displayed button, users can dictate a note, which will be saved immediately using Vokoder. Two smaller buttons allow notes to be recorded in audio version, or written for text versions. Notes can be created, viewed, and deleted from iPhone and Apple Watch. iPhone will additionally allow editing text. 

This app will be written in Swift.

Features:
• Dictate notes on iPhone or Apple Watch
• Record audio notes
• Write text notes
• Persistent storage of notes
• View and delete notes from iPhone and Apple Watch
• Edit text notes from iPhone

Stretch Goals:
• Move storage of notes to a cloud server
• Convert audio notes to text notes
• Translate notes (language translation with some framework)
• Animations to make UI pop (on both iPhone and Apple Watch)
